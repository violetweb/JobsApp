Angular 2.0, My Journey to Build a Jobs Management Application.
http://violetweb.ca/responsive/angularjs-2-journey/

Well, started my course on Angular2 and decided to journal my experiences and to share my discoveries as I embark on learning the newest version of Angular 2.0.   

I've decided that I will build a Jobs Management Application using Angular 2.0 as I continue learning to code Angular 2.0.  It will be my way to extent the courseware to a real application.

Other technologies employed are mySQL to hold the data.  node.js / express to supply the restful api to serve up the data for consumption from my app.
